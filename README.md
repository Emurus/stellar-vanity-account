# Stellar Vanity Account
Use this Kotlin/JVM program to generate a Stellar Account the ends with the name you provide.

## How to use
* Install Java 8
* Run: `java -jar ./Stellar-Account-Vanity`
* Follow the on-screen prompt
* Wait for a period of time (takes longer the more characters entered)
* Note: To avoid very long wait times, I recommend using a name of max 4 characters
* Note: NEVER EVER share your secret key (starting with the letter S) with anyone

## Example
```
Result:
Found Stellar keypair in 2816 tries
public key: GC...XLM
secret key: S...SLY
```
As you can see the public key ends with the provided name: XLM.
